          <br />
          I'm still not quite sure how I want to structure this blog ... I've
          been looking up a lot of other blogs and can't help but envy their
          designs. I don't want to copy them persay, but I want to create my own
          original blog composition by modelling off of other ones. For now, I
          will suffice with this! <br />
          So I am writing this at school, and today I only had one class. Now
          for the entire day I studied Japanese, ate food, and then studied
          coding. It's approximately 2:38pm, and I am surrounded by some really
          hard working people. <br />
          I wonder about whether or not they take any breaks. My teacher on my
          left showed me his payslip today, and said,"I make this much money,
          yet I work very hard!" and bursted into laughter with the teacher to
          my right. <br />
          Then we started to work silently away. Then shortly afterwards, one of
          my other teachers requested me to write a graduation message for the
          grade 6 students. I grabbed the last snowman piece of paper and wrote
          something along the lines of: <br />
          <div align="center">
          <br />
          Hello wonderful grade 6 students. Congratulations! I hope you continue
          studying English, and every other subject with all your heart. Never
          stop chasing your dreams, and when life gives you lemons, make
          lemonade. </div><br />
          <br />
          I thought long and hard about that metaphor today.  I realized that I really did receive a lot of lemons in my life. 
          <br/>
          Shortly after, my teacher on my left showed me his message to the grade 6 students:
          <br/><br/>
          <div align="center"><strong>
          "The truth shall set you free."</strong>
          </div>
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </p>
