                Just as the acronym states, I have yet to determine my future, my motives, and my self.  To put it more optimistically, my journey is ever changing, and only uncertainly lies ahead from here.
        
                Observing and recording the unpredictable happenings within the timeline of the cosmic vessel known as Tri Bui Dorothy.

        This is a personal blog website that serves the purpose of showcasing my basic
        understanding of programming, and my artistic and literary expression.  I only began coding since the beginning of December 2018.  I am mainly interested in the aesthetics side of coding, but if I was to create something practical and beneficial to someone, I'd be very happy.  That being said, everything is experimental, and I am still quite a beginner at everything.  I'm open to comments and constructive criticism if there is anything to suggest or change.  If so, go ahead and send a message to my e-mail, which can be found in the contacts section, otherwise cheers and enjoy! :)
